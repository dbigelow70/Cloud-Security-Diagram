# Cloud Security Diagram

## Objective
After a separate project to build, secure, and protect a cloud application to host my own cyber blog, I then created a network diagram of the cloud security created.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding the roles and communication (SSH, HTTP) between firewalls, load balancer, segmentation, and VMs
- Network architecture

## Tools Used
draw.io

## Steps
First, it was necessary to link and configure the necessary parts of the infrastructure:
- Azure virtual network
- Network security group
- Load Balancer
- Firewall
- JumpBox Provisioner
- 2 internal Docker containers

And then I used draw.io to complete a visual summary of the infrastructure:
